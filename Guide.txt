		Arduino Vinyl Mp3 Player
------------------------------------------------

This is a simple mp3 player activated with a touch sensitive button that plays the mp3s on the dfplayer sd card.

It also displays the current track onto the i2c LCD screen by keeping track of the current playing song and pulling the associated
title from the album array.

The code is pretty basic and should be easy to modify, I used it to mount into a vinyl display frame to have it play tracks
when you press the touch button but you could find plenty of other uses for it.

I used an Arduino Nano a 16x4 I2C LCD, a DFPlayer module and a TTP223 capacitive touch button.

I also used two small 2w speakers that produce just enough sound to be useable but small enough they can fit behind the slim
vinyl frame.

There are plenty of ways this could be modified, you could add more functions quite easily, I considered having the touch button
just play a random track everytime it was pressed but decided eventually on the skip function.

A single press plays the initial track,
Two quick presses skips track,
Three quick presses players previous track,
A long press (which is defined as 5 in the code) resets the module (and stops music playing)

Anyway, I struggled to find the parts to make a drawing so:

5v to VCC on TTP223, I2C LCD and DFPlayer
GND to TTP223, I2C LCD and DFPlayer
D11 to DFPlayer RX
D10 to DFPlayer TX
D8 to TTP223 I/O
A4 to I2C SDA
A5 to I2C SCL

Have fun!
